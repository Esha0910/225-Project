# Project:
# Currency Exchange Rate Analysis
This project conducts a thorough exploration of historical exchange rates, focusing on Euro to USD. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), including data cleaning and visualization, the project unveils patterns and relationships within the dataset. The subsequent predictive modeling employs ARIMA and machine learning techniques for forecasting future exchange rates. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared and mean absolute error. This project contributes valuable insights into exchange rate dynamics, supporting informed decision-making in the financial domain.

# Introduction:
The primary motivation of this project is to undertake a real-world data analysis task and in the process understand how what we do is tied to what we’ve learnt in the course. Focused on time series prediction, the project aims to unravel the complexities of this domain, showcasing the relevance of our learning in tangible applications.

The project's core revolves around historical EUR/USD exchange rates—a dataset pulsating with dynamic currency value fluctuations. Utilizing an arsenal of tools and technologies such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, and scikit-learn, we embark on a comprehensive analysis journey. The objective is to dive into the intricacies of time series analysis and leverage this knowledge to construct a predictive model. The main aim is to develop a model capable of effectively estimating future
exchange rates, contributing to an enhanced understanding of underlying patterns within the financial domain.

This approach involves leveraging various tools, including statistical modeling, ARIMA models, machine learning techniques, and visualization tools.
